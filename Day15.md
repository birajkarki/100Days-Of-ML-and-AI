📊 #Day15 Update: Learning Data Joining with pandas! 🐼

📚 On Day 15 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I dedicated my time to mastering the art of joining data with pandas. Here's a glimpse of my day:

🔹 Course Accomplished: I successfully completed the "Joining Data with pandas" course on DataCamp. This course is an essential cornerstone for any aspiring Data Scientist, providing crucial skills in combining, organizing, joining, and reshaping multiple datasets.

🔹 Course Highlights: Throughout the course, I delved into the fundamentals of data merging, understanding various join types (inner, left, right, outer), and advanced techniques like semi-joins and anti-joins. I also learned how to handle ordered and time-series data effectively and even got hands-on experience with real-world datasets from the World Bank and the City of Chicago.
