Here's what I accomplished:
ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks Essentials: Today's focus was on understanding Activation Functions, Optimizers, and the process of Creating a Model using TensorFlow.
ðŸ”¹ Hands-On Project: I put my knowledge to work by Classifying Fashion-MNIST with a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras.

As I journey through Neural Networks, I'm excited to learn more about their intricacies and applications in machine learning and AI.
Stay tuned as I delve even deeper into the world of AI and continue this incredible learning adventure! ðŸš€
