ðŸ“Š #Day12 Update: Navigating the World of Neural Networks! ðŸ§ 

ðŸ“š On Day 12 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I embarked on a deep dive into the realm of neural networks. Here's what I accomplished:

ðŸ”¹ Neural Network Demystified: Neural networks can be quite challenging, especially for beginners in the field of machine learning. However, I'm excited to share that I've been working through video courses by Brandon Rohrer, which are designed to make these concepts and the math behind them more accessible.
ðŸ”¹ Revision Recap: Today, I also dedicated time to revise and reinforce my understanding of the concepts I've learned from Day 1 to Day 11. It's essential to solidify the foundation for more advanced learning.
