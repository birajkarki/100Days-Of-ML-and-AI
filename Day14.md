📊 #Day14 Update: Mastering Data Manipulation with pandas! 🐼

📚 On Day 14 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I focused on enhancing my data manipulation skills with pandas. Here's a snapshot of my day:

🔹 Course Completed: I successfully completed the "Data Manipulation with pandas" course on DataCamp. This course deepened my understanding of why pandas is the world's most popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

🔹 Key Takeaways: Throughout the course, I delved into core data science concepts, including DataFrame inspection, fundamental manipulations, aggregations, slicing, indexing, and visualization. I honed my skills by working with real-world datasets, such as Walmart sales figures and global temperature time series.

This learning experience has empowered me to extract, filter, and transform data efficiently, adding more power to my Python toolkit.
