ðŸ“Š #Day11 Update: Expanding Skills in Python and TensorFlow! ðŸŒŸ

ðŸ“š On Day 11 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I made significant progress:

ðŸ”¹ TensorFlow Module Completed: I successfully completed the TensorFlow module from the "Machine Learning with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp. This module has provided me with a solid foundation in TensorFlow, empowering me to work with neural networks efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Python Course: I also wrapped up the "Improve Your Python Skills" course on DataCamp. This course allowed me to deepen my Python knowledge and explore new Python applications and functions. I covered topics like Python dictionaries, pandas dataframes, boolean logic, loops, and even applied these skills to calculate probabilities and make predictions.
