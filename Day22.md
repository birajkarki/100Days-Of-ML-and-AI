ðŸ“Š #Day22 Update: Conquering Supervised Learning with scikit-learn! ðŸ¤–

ðŸ“š On Day 22 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I've been deeply immersed in the world of supervised learning using scikit-learn. Here's a snapshot of my day:

ðŸ¤– Course Completion: I'm thrilled to announce that I've successfully completed the "Supervised Learning with scikit-learn" course. This course has been an incredible journey into harnessing the power of scikit-learn, a popular Python library, for training machine learning models with labeled data.
ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:

Classification: I've mastered the art of solving classification problems through supervised learning. From data splitting and model fitting to prediction making and accuracy evaluation, I've gained a deep understanding of these concepts. I even had the opportunity to apply these techniques to a real-world churn dataset.

Fine-Tuning Models: Evaluating models and optimizing them have become second nature to me. I've explored various metrics and visualization techniques to assess model performance. Additionally, I've learned the art of hyperparameter tuning to enhance the accuracy of classification and regression models.

Regression: I've dived into the world of regression, where I built models to predict sales values using an advertising expenditure dataset. Linear regression mechanics, performance metrics like R-squared and root mean squared error, k-fold cross-validation, and regularization techniques are now part of my skill set.

Preprocessing and Pipelines: I've learned the critical steps of data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, converting categorical data to numeric values, and scaling data. Furthermore, I can efficiently evaluate multiple supervised learning models simultaneously and construct pipelines for streamlined workflows.
