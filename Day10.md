ðŸ“Š #Day10 Update: Reflecting on a Learning Journey! ðŸ§ 

ðŸ“š On Day 10 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I continued progressing through the "Machine Learning with Python" course from FreeCodeCamp. It's been an enlightening ride so far! ðŸš€

Today, I had an insightful revision of the modules covered from Day 1 to Day 10.
Here's a snapshot of the key topics I've delved into:
ðŸ”¹ Neural Networks with TensorFlow: Including Activation Functions, Optimizers, Creating a Model
ðŸ”¹ Convolutional Neural Networks: Understanding Layers, Building and Evaluating Models
ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing With RNNs: Exploring Recurring Neural Networks, Sentiment Analysis, Predictions

As I take a moment to reflect, I'm excited about the progress made and the knowledge gained. The journey continues with even more to explore and learn ahead.
