ðŸ“Š #Day21 Update: Exploring the Foundations of Machine Learning! ðŸ§ 
On my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey:

ðŸ¤– Supervised Machine Learning: I've completed Week 1 of the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" course from Coursera, offered in partnership with Stanford University and led by the renowned instructor, Andrew Ng.

In this week, I dived into the basics of machine learning, including:

Machine Learning Defined: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence dedicated to creating algorithms that can learn patterns and make predictions from data.

Supervised Learning: I now understand that supervised learning involves training algorithms on labeled data to grasp the connection between inputs and corresponding outputs.

Unsupervised Learning: I've learned that unsupervised learning is an approach where algorithms analyze unlabeled data to unveil hidden patterns, clusters, or structures within the data.

Jupyter Notebooks: I can write and execute Python code efficiently using Jupyter Notebooks, a fantastic tool for data analysis and machine learning.

Regression Models: I comprehend that regression models are used for predicting continuous numerical values by finding a function that maps input features to a continuous output.

Cost Functions: I can implement and visualize cost functions, mathematical measures assessing how well a machine learning model's predictions align with actual data. Visualizing cost functions helps me grasp how a model's performance varies with different parameters.

Gradient Descent: I've delved into gradient descent, an optimization algorithm essential for minimizing the cost function and refining machine learning models. It iteratively adjusts model parameters to reach the minimum cost.

Optimizing Regression Models: Applying gradient descent, I can optimize regression models by fine-tuning model parameters to minimize the cost function, ultimately enhancing the model's accuracy.

These foundational concepts provide a robust understanding of machine learning, setting the stage for further exploration and learning in this exciting field! ðŸš€
