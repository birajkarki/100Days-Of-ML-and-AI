🔍 #Day18 Update: Rechecking the Foundations! 📚

On the 18th day of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I took a step back to review and reinforce the fundamental concepts I've learned so far. Here's what I revisited:

🧠 Core Concepts: I revisited the core concepts of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics, and feature engineering. It's essential to keep these principles sharp.

🤖 TensorFlow Refresher: I revisited TensorFlow and practiced building simple neural networks. Repetition is key to mastery!

📊 Pandas Practice: I sharpened my data manipulation skills in pandas by working with different datasets. Pandas is such a versatile library, and practice makes perfect.

🧐 Code Review: I spent some time reviewing and optimizing my past machine learning projects. There's always room for improvement!

📈 Goal Reflection: I also reflected on my journey's goals and progress, ensuring I'm on the right track.

This process of rechecking and recalling helps solidify my understanding and ensures I'm well-prepared for more advanced topics in the coming days.
