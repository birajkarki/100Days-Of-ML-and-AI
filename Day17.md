ðŸ“Š #Day17 Update: Conquering Machine Learning Fundamentals! ðŸ¤–

ðŸ“š On Day 17 of my #100DaysOfMLandAI journey, I achieved a significant milestone by completing the entire "Machine Learning with Python" course on FreeCodeCamp.
Here's a glimpse of my accomplishments:
ðŸ”¹ Course Mastery: I successfully covered a wide range of topics, including TensorFlow, core learning algorithms, neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. This comprehensive course provided me with a strong foundation in machine learning.
ðŸ”¹ Project Success: Alongside the course, I also completed challenging coding projects, demonstrating my practical knowledge of machine learning.
Projects like "Rock Paper Scissors," "Cat and Dog Image Classifier," "Book Recommendation Engine," "Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator," and "Neural Network SMS Text Classifier" were both challenging and rewarding.

This journey has been incredibly enlightening, and I'm excited to apply my newfound knowledge in real-world machine learning projects.
